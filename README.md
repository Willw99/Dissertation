# Dissertation - Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP)
EVRP is a NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem, where there is a fleet of EVs and the goal is to determine the best route for each EV starting and ending at the central depot, to serve a set of customers within the battery charge level limits. EVRP also includes charging stations where an EV can charge on its route to customers. EVRP is an extension of Vehicle Routing Problem and the Travelling Salesman Problem and makes the assumptions: time taken between destinations are constant, time taken to recharge an EV is constant, All EVs are recharged to full charge regardless of the time taken to charge.
